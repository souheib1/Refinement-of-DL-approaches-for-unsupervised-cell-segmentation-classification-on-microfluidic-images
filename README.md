# Refinement-of-DL-approaches-for-unsupervised-cell-segmentation-classification-on-microfluidic-images
Research internship 2023 at Telecom Paris



1. Adapt image pre-processing to the density of cells imaged (robustness to contrast change).

2. Refine a CNN solution for cell segmentation based on preliminary results trained on CellPose and error annotation exploring "Human in the loop" training.

3. Develop an "outliers" filter to detect erroneous cell patches (i.e. patches with "out of range" intensities, "multi-cell" patches).

4. Refine a preliminary VAE (variational auto-encoder) approach pre-trained on several cell types for unsupervised clustering to several datasets with different experimental conditions.
